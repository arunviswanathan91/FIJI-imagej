# Unified Olympus OIR Batch Processing Macro (Fiji / ImageJ)

## Overview

This repository contains a **Fiji / ImageJ macro (`.ijm`)** for automated **batch processing of Olympus OIR microscopy image files**.  
The macro standardizes image import, channel handling, and stack logic, enabling **reproducible, high-throughput image preprocessing** with minimal manual interaction.

This workflow is intended for **research and academic microscopy analysis**.

## Repository Structure

Recommended folder layout:

```
.
├── unified fiji.ijm          # Main Fiji/ImageJ macro
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
├── input_data/               # Raw Olympus OIR files (user-provided)
│   └── *.oir
├── output_data/              # Processed images generated by the macro
│   ├── channels/
│   ├── stacks/
│   └── projections/
└── logs/                     # Optional Fiji log exports
```

**Notes:**
- `input_data/` should contain only raw, unmodified microscopy files.
- `output_data/` is created or populated automatically by the macro.
- Folder names can be changed, but must match paths defined inside the macro.

## Features

- Batch import of Olympus OIR files
- Automatic detection of:
  - Channel-only images
  - Multi-channel Z-stacks
- Deterministic and reproducible processing
- Minimal user interaction
- Informative logging via Fiji Log window

---

## Requirements

- **Fiji (ImageJ distribution)**  
  https://fiji.sc

- Olympus OIR import support (included in standard Fiji)

**Recommended version:** Fiji / ImageJ ≥ 1.53

---

## File Description

- `unified fiji.ijm`  
  Main ImageJ macro implementing the batch processing workflow.

## How to Run the Macro

### 1. Install Fiji
Download Fiji from:
```
https://fiji.sc
```

### 2. Open the Macro
1. Launch **Fiji**
2. Go to:
   ```
   Plugins → Macros → Edit…
   ```
3. Open:
   ```
   unified fiji.ijm
   ```

### 3. Configure Paths
If required, edit input/output directory paths at the top of the macro to match your local folder structure.

### 4. Run
- Click **Run** in the Macro Editor
- Follow any prompts
- Monitor progress in the **Log** window

---

## Output

- Processed images are saved automatically
- Channel and stack structures are handled consistently
- Running the macro multiple times on identical input produces identical output

---

## Customization

You may modify:
- Input/output directories
- Channel handling logic
- Image processing steps (e.g., projections, conversions)

⚠️ Ensure all conditional branches remain consistent when editing.
